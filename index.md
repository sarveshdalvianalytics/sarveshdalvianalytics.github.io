excerpt: "Football analysis, reports, and dashboards"

I’m Sarvesh, a sports data & performance analyst. I turn match data into clear, coach-ready insights-reports, visuals, and live dashboards. Most work here is football-first, with a few cross-sport case studies. Reporting, event coding, and dashboards. I care about clarity, repeatable methods, and answering the question “so what?” for coaches and players.
Focus: decision support (selection, load, set-plays), opposition analysis, and simple visuals that travel well in staff rooms.

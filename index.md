I’m Sarvesh, a sports data & performance analyst. I turn match data into clear, coach-ready insights—reports, visuals, and live dashboards. Most work here is football-first, with a few cross-sport case studies.
Focus: decision support (selection, load, set-plays), opposition analysis, and simple visuals that travel well in staff rooms.
